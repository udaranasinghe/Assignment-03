In practical eight, msbar tool is used to incoorporate mismatches in in the provided DNA sequence(sample 09). so, the important data such as, length of the sequence, e-value, number of mismatches and bit score can be anlised within a very short time. using this tool is really important in extract a specific genetic information from the huge data set and to do the analyse. the ability to save the codes in GitHub also helps to use the knowledge for future studies. 

In practical 9 different objects of R is used to read in files properly , subsetting and searching for data and for generating some graphs like pairs graph. making scatterplots and pairs graphs provides an proper idea about the distribution of data making easy to analyse and compare the experinment data. further, the ability to save the code works separately might help to future works. so, the basic Math tasks like calculation of standard deviation and average can also e performed by using R.
